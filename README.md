# 🏠 House Price Prediction

This project is focused on building a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features. It demonstrates the end-to-end pipeline of a regression problem — from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model building, evaluation, and saving the final model.

## 💡 Overview

House price prediction is a common regression task in data science. This project uses supervised learning techniques to estimate the selling price of a house using key property attributes like size, rooms, location indicators, and more.

## 🔧 Features
